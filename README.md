## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** The platform makes implementing user interfaces easy and friendly with lot of customization

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

ArrayAdapter used by android helps to attach or present data from any data source to a UI element. Or can be said to return a view per data/object in a data source

**Answer:** ConvertView track views that can be reuse, this helps to improve the performance of the app by ensuring better resource utilization.
