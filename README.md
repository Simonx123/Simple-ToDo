Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

The platform makes implementing user interfaces easy and friendly with lot of customization

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

ArrayAdapter used by android helps to attach or present data from any data source to a UI element. Or can be said to return a view per data/object in a data source

ConvertView track views that can be reuse, this helps to improve the performance of the app by ensuring better resource utilization.
